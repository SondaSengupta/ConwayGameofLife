# ConwayGameofLife
A display of Conway's Game using HTML, CSS, and pure JS.

##The Rules
Based off John Conway's game published in 1970, this game is a zero-state game in which no further input is required after initially creating the board. There are three rules:

- A cell lives if it has 2-3 neighboring cells around it.
- A dead cell regenerates if there are 3 neighboring cells around it.
- Cells with lower than 2 or higher than 3 living neighbors dies.
